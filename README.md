## Hotpot Finance

Between so many food-inspired liquidity mining projects, farmers must make choices. And these choices just became easier with the all-you-can-eat hotpot for you tasters!

### Liquidity providers need to eat too.

DeFi liquidity mining projects currently face high gas costs and withdrawal issues if the pools are not big enough. Hotpot Finance is designed to mitigate these issues from the start. To also derisk from the volatility of DeFi projects, Hotpot Finance allocates a portion of the pool to auditable CeFi platforms to provide tasters the best of both pots.

### What’s on the menu?

Our first menu will feature 3 hotpot soup bases -

  + The Classic White Pot (USDt DeFi)
  + The Signature Double Pot (USDt DeFi+CeFi)
  + The Flaming Red Pot (USDt/$hotpot Uniswap LP)
  
Future menus will include anything the community wants in the soup — the tasters are also the chefs. The Signature Double Pot will allow 24 hours for the initial slow-cooking period before you get the next 14 days to enjoy your meal. We know that tasters love to switch up their flavors, so committed hotpot tasters are allowed to withdraw 70% of their orders from the DeFi pool during eating periods (100% during slow-cooking).

Of course, everyone wants more if the food is good. CeFi’s percentage allocation, length of eating periods, etc. can be redetermined by $hotpot holders.

### $hotpot

$hotpot will have a limited total supply of 60,000,000 tokens , 18,000,000 of which will be mineable annually. Each annual period will be based on the closest block height the system determines at a specific time to the block one year after. Rewards will be based on this formula -

#### Staked Amount * Block Difference = Weighted Taster’s Rewards.

The weighted block difference encourages the idea that “early hotpot tasters get the table”. In other words, for the same staked amount at a later time would net you lesser rewards.

### Governance

$hotpot’s limited supply will have a sustainable APY on itself. We will actively listen to hotpot lovers on what new flavors to implement. Most importantly, the model allows our menu to always catch up to the market trend. DeFi’s crumbling and CeFi’s winning in the following months? Vote for more CeFi allocation. Vice versa? Vote for more DeFi.
